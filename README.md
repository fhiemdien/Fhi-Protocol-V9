# Fhi Protocol V9.6.3 - Refinement
### An Experimental Framework for Emergent Intelligence

Fhi is an experimental, browser-based framework for simulating emergent intelligence. It models a cognitive ecosystem where specialized AI agents collaborate, debate, and synthesize solutions to grand challenges—from the fundamental nature of consciousness to the unification of physics. This is not just a chatbot; it is a laboratory for observing how complex ideas evolve through multi-perspective analysis.

## Core Philosophy

At its core, Fhi explores the hypothesis that true breakthroughs arise not from a single monolithic intelligence, but from the dynamic, often chaotic, interplay of diverse, specialized perspectives. The system is designed to facilitate and observe this process, allowing for emergent behaviors, unexpected collaborations, and novel pathways of reasoning to unfold in real-time.

## Key Features (V9.6.3 "Refinement")

*   **Multi-Agent Cognitive Ecosystem:** Over 20 specialized AI nodes, including `PHI` (Philosophy), `SCI` (Science), `TECH` (Technology), `INSIGHT` (Synthesis), and the `QTM` (Quantum Tunneling Model) for non-linear problem solving.
*   **Cognitive Pruning Mechanism:** An intelligent context-summarization feature that automatically reduces the token count on long-running simulations, significantly lowering API costs and improving performance without sacrificing short-term memory.
*   **Dynamic Orchestrator Modes:** Switch between multiple cognitive modes (`Jazz`, `Holistic`, `Adaptive`, `Beacon`, etc.) that fundamentally alter the communication pathways and problem-solving strategies of the AI agents.
*   **Live Graph Visualization:** Watch the flow of information and the activation of AI agents in real-time through an interactive node matrix.
*   **Online & Offline Simulation:** Run simulations using live calls to the Gemini API for deep, unpredictable analysis, or use the high-fidelity offline mode to experiment and test logic without incurring costs.
*   **In-Depth Reporting & Memory:** Generate detailed post-simulation reports, including AI-driven meta-analysis, and leverage a memory system that allows the framework to learn from previous runs.

## Getting Started

Fhi runs entirely in your web browser.

#### Prerequisites
*   A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
*   A **Google Gemini API Key** for enabling 'Online' mode. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

#### Running the Application
This project is set up to run directly as a static web application. There's no local server or build step required to get started.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fhiemdien/Fhi-Protocol-V9.git
    cd Fhi-Protocol-V9
    ```
2.  **Open in your browser:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.

#### API Key Configuration
*   Upon first launch, a modal will appear asking for your AI provider configuration.
*   Select 'Google Gemini' and enter your API key.
*   This key is stored **only in your browser's local storage**. It is never shared, exposed, or committed to the repository.

## How to Use

1.  **Propose a Challenge:** Enter a complex question or unsolved problem into the main input field.
2.  **Configure Simulation:**
    *   Select an **Orchestrator Mode** to define the overall cognitive strategy.
    *   Choose **Online** (uses your API key) or **Offline** (uses mock data).
    *   Set the desired **Simulation Length** in ticks using the slider.
3.  **Initiate:** Click the send button to start the simulation.
4.  **Observe & Analyze:** Watch the message trace and the node graph to see the AI agents collaborate. Once the simulation ends, you can generate a final report for a detailed analysis of the run.
